# sandbox
Foundation application - knowledge map

Recovered from public domain de facto, on the 7th of April 2024.

# sandbox is an XML/XSLT application running on navigators.

But when recovering it, I was not able to prompt it - i.e. find the index. In this word shift, we intend to encompass the Test Revolution. We have Turing persons around us. Now. It was not the case in 2018 when this repository ceases to exist. Even if in 2015 an artificial player won the last game that resists to machine, it was more a philosophical matter than a market one. That machine thinks learn us many things. And I'm deeply sure Alan would be delighted to see what we actually see. He had forceen it. But in reality, it is something else all together.

At that time, 2018, the focus was elsewhere. The magnificent work of Satoshi was yet shining but its commercial prophet Vitalik chooses a dead end to our eyes — with Turing-Complete contract granularity amendments, so called "smart-contract" [Ú†ßπ]. We won an affair the day after DAO crash in June 2017. Recently, we state that bitcoin solution to contract signature issued in 2021 was a correct response to the commercial sollicitation. There is one chain, *bitcoin* and there are sollicitations from the crypto-DeFI ecosystem. Today, bitcoin is a registered SEC product with arm-long proficiencies, with bitcoin should we choose fusion or sollicitation?

How do you we state politicial issues like this? For now, crypto-communities are not yet able to propose something alternative to an avatar of mediation. To overcome that structuring limitation, we propose the Romulus Solution, to draw circles on a single surface — a local plane on a sphere with some tunnels or "holes" [EDMNUDS-1959]. We found this method in 2008, and during lock-down, we found an old reference of graphical processing which was it. How to describe this surface? Edmunds wonders, and I long ago and still, that a simple graph would do. Like Groenthendieck's "Dessin d'Enfant", combinatorial map where drawn graph — the sand interaction from Archimedes to Hypathie (AGORA).

There are "sand drawings" on Vavuatu archipel where every finger track is a loop. You may go many times at the same place to tune the output. In our drawing model, can either draw loops (zero) or stitch links between them (unity). The graph are said "planar" — this means that a syntactic expression from a POV is Turing-Safe. Let's dive right into the syntax: any loop defines a circular order of its stitch intersection. This is a serious candidate for overall space/time discret structure:
```
a b d c g h j y t r
k l y h t r g e d s 
p l o k l a f e d s
```
in his paper, Edmunds says that a torus is:
```
a b
a b
```
And that's is a fact.

Our basic contribution is to remark that bitcoin is dead simple in that context : a cadenced messaging system which bodies are some integers and in brackets, insights to free some these integers. The difference between liberations and consumption is called the "fee" and compensate system growth.

```
(TBD: provide under this syntax a bunch of bitcoin track)
